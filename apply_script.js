Hi xxxxxx,

I saw the job post and believe my skills closely match the requirements
for the position. My most recent projects include web applications built with JavaScript, React, React Native, Redux, Ruby on Rails, Node.js, etc.

A little about me, I’ m a software engineer who enjoys building solutions to everyday problems through the power of code.My background is in Aerospace Engineering and since college(last 4 years), I have worked as a Process Engineer
for a semiconductor company where my work ethic and passion
for engineering enabled me to successfully spearhead several projects to reduce costs and improve yield;
increasing revenue by $4 + million annually.

I know you must be super busy but I was hoping I could get 10 minutes of your time for a quick phone conversation.I would love to learn more about Riot Games and understand what you’re looking for in a candidate.

Would you be free sometime next week ? For your reference, my resume can be found on www.adrianrivero.me. I look forward to connecting!

Thank you
for your time.I look forward to speaking with you.
